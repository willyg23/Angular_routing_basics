<h1>Home page</h1>

<!-- dont use href in angular. href causes your webpages to completely reload whenever the app is clicked
instead use routerLink
which tells angular to treat it as an interal route -->

<a routerLink="/animals">Animal List</a>
<!-- when you click on this link, it routes you to the corresponding component (animalsComponent) -->
